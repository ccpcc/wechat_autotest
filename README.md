# weichat_autotest
Our chemistry learning group need to do some exercises during the summer or winter holiday. 
But it is hard to gather all of us because nearly everyone will have a trip with their family. 
That's why I write this script.

the script can auto reply what your friends said to you on weichat and help them to get the questions.
As soon as they get the questions a timer will be set from which you can know how long they take to finish the test.
A test number will be given too.
they can post their answers by pictures or other type of file, which will be download to your computer and put in a folder named by their nickname on weichat. 

Now the project only has a Chinese version without annotation or API.
